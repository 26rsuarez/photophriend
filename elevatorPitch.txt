When entering the world of photography, it can seem a little overwhelming.  There are, however, a few simple tricks that can allow even the absolute beginner to take stunning photos.  When dealing with outdoor and natural light photography, the most important element is, obviously, light.  The time of day and amount of sunlight have a profound effect on photos, whether they are landscape shots or portraits. We have created FotoFriend as a helpful tool for the aspiring photographer.  FotoFriend allows the user to look up sunrise and sunset times (the most ideal times for outdoor photography) for any specific area, as well as allowing them to check the local weather forecast.  A cloudy day gives much more even light than a day with harsh, direct sunlight.  There will also be a button the user can press to generate a random photography tip ranging from how to get a dog to pay attention to you to how to make sure you don't leave too much headspace in portraits.  It is our goal that using these tools, the art of photography will become more accessible to even the complete novice.
